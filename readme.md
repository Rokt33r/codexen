This is a prototype CLI app to decide what we(MAISIN&CO.) should do.
Now, we decided, and made an OS X app with [Electron](electron.atom.io).
You can find the app here, [codexen.github.io](http://codexen.github.io).
It is a some kind of snippet management app.
The features of this CLI app will be embeded soon.

> After the OS X app secured, we will remake this CLI app.
Thanks you for reading this message.
